steps:
1. get ovpn file (tcp is prefered) from vpngate website;

2. add the following 3 lines at the tail of each ovpn file(it is used to update dns during the connection):
script-security 2
up /etc/openvpn/update-resolv-conf
down /etc/openvpn/update-resolv-conf

3. connect command(can use --daemon to get rid of terminal):
nohup sudo openvpn --config vpngate_219.100.37.122_tcp_443.ovpn --remote-cert-tls server --tcp-queue-limit 512 &

4. disconnect command:
sudo killall -SIGINT openvpn
